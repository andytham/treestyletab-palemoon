# treestyletab
Tree Style Tab bare minimum working version for Pale Moon, edited again to work specifically for Dark Moon theme.

Forked from oinkoink's fork of YUKI "Piro" Hiroshi's indispensable Tree Style Tabs addon for Firefox, which unfortunately stopped working in Pale Moon.

This no longer exists (at least in the same way) on Firefox due to XUL no longer being supported.

## Maintenance

This is a personal use version.
